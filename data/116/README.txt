This participant had a lot of difficulty with the timing-- the first time around, they went the entire 200 practice trials without 5 in a row.
Then skipped the instruction page on the first go/no, so I restarted the entire thing.
Second time around, they got the criterion more quickly, but generally had timing issues.
